# Boutique â€” The boutique manager

To start development, install [npm] and run

    npm update --dev

from the root of the project (no need to be the root user).

You can get a list of all available commands with:

    ./jake -T

Install `jake` globally to avoid the `./`:

    npm install jake -g

[npm]: http://npmjs.org/
